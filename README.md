2. Put this file inside `/opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/` directory of your Jans server
3. Edit `/opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/webapps/jans-auth.xml` and append below line between `<set name="extractClasspath">...</Set>` and save the file:
   ```
   /opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/libs/agama-inbound-1.0.19-jar-with-dependencies.jar,/opt/jans/jetty/jans-auth/custom/
   ```

      "clientSecret": "CLIENT_SECRET",
      "scopes": [

      ],
      "clientCredsInRequestBody": true,
      "custParamsAuthReq": {},
      "custParamsTokenReq": {},

## Test Authentication Flow

Either you can try [jans-tarp](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/tree/main/demos/jans-tarp) or [jans-tent](https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/tree/main/demos/jans-tent) to test the `hello-agama` inbound identity flow to apply hello.coop social logins.
